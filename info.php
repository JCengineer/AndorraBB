	<h3 id="ovH1" class="infoTab">About Andorra B&B</h3>
	<p>
	Nuala and Fionan Clifford purchased the house in 1995 and have led a very busy life since then. 
	Their two sons, James and Eugene, grew up here and attended the local Star of the Sea 
	primary school in Sandymount and St. Michael&#39;s College on Ailesbury Road, just around the corner.
	<br><br>
	Staying at Andorra B&B Dublin, your home from home will be in the exclusive Ballsbridge area, 
	opposite the British Embassy, and close to the RDS, Lansdowne Road sports stadium, 
	the O2 theatre and St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital.
	<br><br>
	There are numerous wonderful restaurants locally including Rolys Bistro, 
	and the local pubs are famous, like Crowes and Paddy Cullens, 
	especially when the matches are on in the RDS or Aviva (Lansdowne) stadium.
