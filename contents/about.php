	<p>
		Nuala and Fionan Clifford purchased the Andorra Bed and Breakfast in 1995 and have led a very busy life since then. 
		Their two sons, James and Eugene, who were just 5 and 1 years of age at the time grew up here and attended the local Star of the Sea 
		primary school in Sandymount and St. Michael&#39;s College on Ailesbury Road, just around the corner.
		<br>
		Fionan is a surveyor who works from home but he is also the chief cook at breakfast.
		We have enjoyed our last 18 years running Andorra B&amp;B and can honestly say we had some wonderfully interesting and kind guests who make it all worthwhile.
		<br><br>
		Our house is Edwardian in style and was built around 1903. The Edwardian style was a revolt against the mass production and pomp of the Victorian era.
		The Edwardian era still continued to use some Victorian ideas but is different in its use of timber boarded doors, leaded casement windows, 
		some small paned sash windows, porches, verandas, tiled roofs with wide overhanging eves and late Georgian style plain fanlights.
		Our house features in the 1911 census but not the 1901. The listing was a Methodist family and a Roman Catholic Female Servant.

		Staying at Andorra B&amp;B Dublin, your home from home, will be in the exclusive Ballsbridge area, 
		opposite the British Embassy, and close to the RDS, Aviva (Lansdowne Road) sports stadium, 
		the 3Arena, Grand Canal Theatre, St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital and many more. See the other tabs for more information.
