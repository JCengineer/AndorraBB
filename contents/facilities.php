	<h3 id="ovH4" class="infoTab">Our facilities and local amenities</h3>
	<p>
		You will have multiple facilities in the room and in the area.
		As we mentioned, there are tea and coffee making facilities in each room.
		TVs, Wifi and electrical outlets are in each room as well. 
		We have a few continental plug adapters too, if you are missing one.
		<br><br>
		Locally, there are shops, restaurants, cafes, public parks and many more amenities within walking distance.
		<br><br>
		Nearby, there are plenty of interesting walks:
		The triangle which is down Merrion  Road, up Shrewsbury Road, left onto Ailesbury road and left again back on to Merrion Road. 
		This is just a mile and has some of the most spectacular houses (and most expensive) in the city.
		Or Sandymount Strand is just a mile from us – down Sandymount Avenue, a bracing walk along the seafront and back up Sydney Parade – 
		no need to turn back on oneself.
		Then there is the Dodder walk which is off the beaten track and very relaxing and probably our favourite of all.
		<br><br>
		Our guests with young children can enjoy the children’s playgrounds in the beautiful Herbert Park locally.
		Herbert Park was taken over by Dublin Corporation in 1932 and provides a children’s playground, facilities for football, tennis, boules, 
		croquet and bowling.
                <br><br>
		St Vincent’s Hospital, both public and private are just 10 minutes from Andorra B &amp; B.
		<br><br>
		The bridge in Ballsbridge village was built in 1637 and was replaced by a bridge of three arches in 1791. 
		This bridge was widened in 1904 to meet the requirements of the traffic to the show grounds established by the Royal Dublin Society in 1881.
		<br><br>
		Ballsbridge is home to many embassies and consulates, mainly in and around Ailesbury Road. Ailesbury Road, along with Shrewsbury Road, 
		makes up the most expensive properties in the Dublin edition of ‘Monopoly’ -  something which is echoed in real life.
		<br><br>
		The American Embassy in Ballsbridge was completed in 1964 and the Embassy describes the building as “a concrete expression of the 
		close relationship between Ireland and the United States”
		<br><br>
		Following the burning of the British Embassy in Merrion Square in 1972, it briefly moved to Sandyfort before relocating to Merrion Road. 
		The existing building was opened by HRH  Princess Anne on 19th January 1996 and won the Royal Institute of British Architects Award in 1997.
